  "introduction": [
    "In the village of Mykolaivka in Eastern Ukraine lives a family filled with love and resilience. Mother Oksana raises 8 children alone — 4 biological and 4 adopted from an orphanage years ago. She has organized this family with love, ensuring every child feels needed and cherished.",
    "Father Ihor served in the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade. He went missing at the front lines (actually killed in action). Because he is officially listed as 'missing' rather than 'killed,' the family cannot receive any government benefits.",
    "This is their fourth home. Due to proximity to the front lines, they may need to relocate again at any moment. Basic necessities are covered, but the children's educational and developmental needs remain unmet."
